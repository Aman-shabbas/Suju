## 📌 Project Goal  

The purpose of this project is to **learn and apply real-world tools and services** commonly used in software development.  

The **first milestone** is to build a **natural language chatbot powered by a custom-built LLM (Large Language Model)**.  

Once the base chatbot is complete, the project will **incrementally expand** to cover:  
- Integration of industry tools & best practices  
- Experimentation with different ML/DL techniques  
- Documentation of all learnings and decisions  
- Hands-on exposure to modern build tools, deployment, and scaling

# Docker documentation

This document explains the role of **Docker** in this project, how it is set up, and details of the configuration file. 

## What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that allows applications to be packaged with all their dependencies into containers.
Containers ensure that the application runs the same way across different environments (development, testing, production), removing the “it works on my machine” problem.
